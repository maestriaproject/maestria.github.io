The success of MAESTRIA relies on the complementary expertise on multi-modal data analysis, information extraction, large-scale machine learning, land-cover mapping, and the relationship between methodological innovations and thematic applications. CESBIO and LaSTIG labs have extensively worked in these domains for more than 10 years and are recognized as (inter)national experts in the analysis of EO images.
